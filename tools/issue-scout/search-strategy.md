# Search strategy: where your scout looks, and why

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE. The scout in SKILL.md executes whatever
queries and filters you define here. It ships empty on purpose: the
strategy is your judgment about where YOUR first contribution lives,
and a scan without authored queries is just someone else's defaults.

A filled strategy must contain:

1. At least one query in the Queries section. Each query is a real
   `gh search issues` invocation, and each should trace to a sentence
   of your fit profile in scope.md: if you cannot say which sentence
   produced a query, the query is probably not yours. Search breadth
   is the point at this stage: prefer generous limits and let the
   ranking filters do the narrowing.

2. At least one ranking filter in the Ranking filters section. A
   filter is a condition or an ordering over fields the search
   results already carry (last activity date, assignee presence,
   label set, comment count, repo). It must be checkable from the
   result fields alone: if deciding it would need opening the issue
   page, it belongs in your rubric, not here. Ranking is the free
   stage; keep it free. Make at least one filter an ordering, or
   state your tie-break: with drop conditions alone, the scout takes
   the top of whatever order the searches happened to return, and
   the graded candidates stop being traceable to you.

3. The top-N line, kept or deliberately changed.

## Queries

<!-- Real gh search invocations, one per line, each with a comment
naming the fit-profile sentence it came from. Example SHAPE (write
your own; these values belong to nobody):

gh search issues --label "good first issue" --language python --state open --limit 100 --json title,repository,labels,assignees,commentsCount,updatedAt,url
-->


Profile: "I've worked with Python (including the Anaconda/Jupyter ecosystem) and with JavaScript/TypeScript."
gh search issues --label "good first issue" --owner jupyter --owner jupyterlab --owner jupyter-server --owner jupyter-widgets --owner voila-dashboards --owner conda --no-assignee --updated ">2026-05-01" --state open --limit 100 --json title,repository,labels,assignees,commentsCount,updatedAt,url

Profile: "I've worked with Python (including the Anaconda/Jupyter ecosystem) and with JavaScript/TypeScript." (widened: these orgs label few issues "good first issue", so "help wanted" adds the rest of the newcomer-facing pool)
gh search issues --label "help wanted" --owner jupyter --owner jupyterlab --owner jupyter-server --owner jupyter-widgets --owner voila-dashboards --owner conda --no-assignee --updated ">2026-05-01" --state open --limit 100 --json title,repository,labels,assignees,commentsCount,updatedAt,url

Profile: "I want to get better at ... explaining technical work clearly, without jargon, in a way that's easy to follow"
gh search issues --label documentation --owner jupyter --owner jupyterlab --owner jupyter-server --owner jupyter-widgets --owner conda --no-assignee --updated ">2026-05-01" --state open --limit 100 --json title,repository,labels,assignees,commentsCount,updatedAt,url

## Ranking filters

<!-- Conditions and orderings over the free result fields, applied in
the order written. State each so a stranger could apply it and get
your ordering. Example SHAPES (write your own):

- drop any result with an assignee
- drop any result not updated in the last 60 days
- prefer fewer comments over more
-->


1. Drop any result with an assignee.
2. Drop any result whose labels include "question", "status:Needs Info", "needs discussion", or "duplicate" (profile: "I'd rather avoid issues that are vague, underspecified, or messy about what actually needs to change").
3. Drop any result with more than 10 comments (a long thread usually means the scope is still being argued).
4. Drop duplicates (the same url returned by more than one query); keep one copy.
5. Order: results labeled "good first issue" first, then all others.
6. Within each group, fewest comments first; ties broken by most recent updatedAt first.

## How many to grade

Grade the top **5** ranked results per scan.

<!-- Five is the default because grading is the only stage that costs
money: about $0.20 per candidate, so a scan is about $1, and you can
iterate the strategy several times for less than one full regression
run. You need one good issue, not ten. Raising this number is
allowed, but it is a decision you state here in a sentence, with the
cost you are accepting; it is not a number you bump because a scan
disappointed you once. -->
